## Installation

### Prerequisites

- JupyterLab 3.x

### Install from pypi

```
python -m pip install jupyterlab-favorites
```

### Install from github

```
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-favorites@v3.0.0#egg=jupyterlab_favorites"
```

### Install locally from a git checkout

```
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-favorites.git
cd jupyterlab-favorites
pip install .
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- An active `conda` environment with JupyterLab 3.x installed

### Install locally from a git checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-favorites.git
cd jupyterlab-favorites
pip install -ve .
```

This copies the frontend code for the extension into JupyterLab.

To keep the source code synced with JupyterLab, you can run the following:

```bash
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .
```

To rebuild the extension manually after each change::

```bash
jlpm run build
```

To automatically rebuild after each change, run in a separate terminal:

```bash
jlpm run watch
```

## Older JupyterLab versions

### JupyterLab v2 Support

NPM install

```bash
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-favorites@2.0.0
```

### Jupyterlab v1 Support

Via NPM:

```{bash}
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-favorites@1.0.0
```

Or use the tagged 1.0.0 release at:
https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-favorites/tree/v1.0.0

## Testing

Download Firefox browser if not already installed: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

Install Selenium:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge selenium
```

Install Pytest:

```bash
conda install -c anaconda pytest
```

Change directory to this repo after cloning

```bash
cd yourfolder/jupyterlab-favorites
```

Running test script:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

This will open jupyter lab and run available tests.
Note: You will need to run in a clean jupyter environment (without existing favorites files)
